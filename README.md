# User-Authentication-with-Live-Video-Conferencing
An application for users worldwide to verify their identity with live video conferencing.
Instead of 2FA or getting an email with an OTP code for password changes on forgotten passwords or new communication method changes for users. Setup a live video conferencing application so the user and the support agent can be sure they're speaking with the correct and verified people. 
No more redirected fake or SPAM emails sending users private data to a breached source.
No more confusion for users wondering if they're actually speaking to the proper support personnel.
